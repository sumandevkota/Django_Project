Step 1:
Install Django using "Pip install Django"

After installation of Django we get to use Django commands 
run "Django-admin" to see list of commands
sometimes this command "Django-admin" is not recognized this that case:
a) open command prompt and get into the project folder by using change directory command "cd path"
b)create a virtual environment by using "python-m venv venv" second venv is the name of virtual environment
c)activate created virtual enviroment by using "venv\Scripts\activate"
this will take you to the virtual enviroment where we will again install django
d) use "pip install django" to install django in virtual environment 

Step 2:
Create a new project using "django-admin startproject yourprojectname"
this will create a directory of our project name 

Step 3:
to run local server use command"python manage.py runserver"


Git: Push code
get to the directory 
step:1 git init
step:2 git add . 
step:3 git status
step:4 git commit -m "your commit"
step:5 git remote add origin "paste git hub url here"
step:6 git push -u origin master
